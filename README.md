### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
By following best practices and writing tests I can ensure that my program is secure and I can also prove it. These tests also prove that the program does what it says it will do with the requirements given.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I can interpret user needs by following a user story with provided requirements. Once I have the list of requirements I can create a program that will fit their needs.

### How do I approach designing software?
Once the program is functional, I then need to think, is this the intention of how the user wanted to use the software. Just because I have met the needs, if the interface is poorly designed, then I should not have
bothered creating the program at all.
